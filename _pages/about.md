[testing on 10/30]
I am a fourth-year student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science with a second major in Business. My interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and interdisciplinary areas. I am particularly passionate about AI and related fields, and I am currently seeking a full-time position in machine learning engineering while preparing for my master’s degree.


# Engineering Experience
### Student Researcher, VIStA Lab, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY
*July 2024 – Present*
The research group are focuses on image understanding and generation,In Professor Jiebo Luo's [here](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/) VIStA Lab ,mentoring by [Alex](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6_4ethMAAAAJ&hl=en),An jie[Jie](https://pkuanjie.com/) and Zhenghong Zhou(https://zhouzhenghong-gt.github.io/). Our research involves enhancing 3D consistency in zero-shot image-to-image tasks. Specifically, I deploy, modify, and test diffusion models, as well as replicate and integrate various research methods. This work aims to improve model performance in handling significant domain gaps between inputs (e.g., animal skeletons) and outputs (fully rendered animal images).

### Machine Learning Engineer Intern, Farsee2 Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China  
*July 2024 – September 2024*  
During my time at Farsee2 Technology, I designed an innovative method to reduce floating components in digital reconstruction models by 40%. This was achieved by utilizing ground truth depth to minimize loss, under the mentorship of Ph.D. Hailong Pan. I also developed a customized workflow for parallel computing across multiple machines, which significantly enhanced computational efficiency. Furthermore, I played a key role in contributing to the upgrade of the core algorithm for the company's digital reconstruction software, leading to more accurate and efficient model outputs.z

### Student Researcher, Goergen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY  
*January 2024 – Auguest 2024*  
As a researcher at the Goergen Institute for Data Science, I focused on the challenging issues of generative fairness and bias in large language models (LLMs), particularly within the context of political ideology. My work involved developing methods to calculate and evaluate political ideologies to conduct blind testing on LLMs. I automated the data collection process using Python and APIs and participate to the maintainess of a comprehensive database containing over 140,000 entries of political ideology sentenses. 


**_I am proud to introduce our research findings in the paper "Using Generative AI to Calculate Party Positions: A Comparison of Human Experts and Large Language Models," which is now available on SSRN [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4907043)._**



### Research Assistant, Professor Chengliang Xu’s Lab, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY  
*May 2024 – Present*  
In this role, I participate into the development a new model for TAD by implementing SSM Mamba. Under the mentorship of PHD Pinxin Liu, I deployed, tested, and improved various machine learning tasks, ensuring successful execution of related paper codes on Linux servers. My work also involved modifying the ViT model to a Transformer structure and enhancing the previous model’s backbone, making it more suitable for testing and debugging by the research team.

**_I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Pinxin for his patience and guidance throughout this research project. He has demonstrated extraordinary patience as an educator, a rigorous yet creative approach as a researcher, and exceptional coding and debugging skills as a machine learning engineer. This project marks my first significant foray into the field of computer vision, and Pinxing, as the project's mentor and initiator, has greatly enhanced my experience during the early stages of my research journey. I also want to extend my thanks to my collaborator, Fangyu Luo, for being willing to answer even my most basic questions and for providing valuable guidance on the coding aspects of our work._**


### Technical Assistant, Wuhan Jingying Haitao Information Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China  
*June 2023 – May 2024*  
As a Technical Assistant, I created a biomedical patent database using MySQL to support the research of Dr. Congjing Ran and Ph.D. Shenshen Liu from Wuhan University. My contributions led to a 20% improvement in data collection efficiency through the development of an automated web crawler script in Python. Additionally, I was responsible for collecting and labeling over 18,000 entries as sample data for language model training. I also utilized Lucidchart to design detailed Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) that optimized data visualization and management, encompassing over 100 keys and attributes.

### Research Assistant, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY  
*May 2022 – December 2022*  
In collaboration with Dr. Zhu, Dr. Jarvis, and other team members, I contributed to the digital reconstruction of the Jamestown Settlement and Elmina Castle using low-cost, image-based 3D Virtual Reality techniques. My responsibilities included disseminating high-resolution models into low-space-cost models for use in virtual reality environments. I utilized Agisoft Metashape and Unity to create detailed 3D models, conducting screening, cleaning, and restoration of raw image data for virtual reality applications. Additionally, I used Adobe Photoshop to repair overlapping virtual camera angles, manually cleaned interfering point clouds, and corrected shadows, lighting, and surface materials.

**_I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the University of Rochester for awarding me the Discover Grant ($5,000), which made this incredibly memorable summer possible. I am also immensely thankful to the staff at StudioX for their invaluable support and assistance throughout this experience._**


# Projects

### OpenJDK 17u-dev  
[TODO, make link, to the repo. and the documentation]
*July 2024 – August 2024*  
For the OpenJDK 17u-dev project, I authored a comprehensive step-by-step installation guide on GitHub for deploying JDK on Linux local testing environments. I also contributed to the testing and acceptance of pull request #2756(8313674) in Ubuntu 22, which helped in improving the stability and performance of the JDK.

### IMDB Database Project  
*August 2023 – December 2023*  
Leading a team of three, I ensured the database compliance and enhanced security of an IMDB Database project. My role involved focusing on testing, compatibility assessment, and debugging to prevent injection attacks. I also implemented a login system and customized functions for CRUD operations based on user type using JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML, Git, and CSS. Additionally, I redesigned the website's UI and incorporated advanced database security features.

### Body Signals Analysis Project  
*September 2023 – December 2023*  
In the Body Signals Analysis Project, I preprocessed over 900,000 records by selecting relevant attributes through feature engineering and reducing dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). I developed NLP machine learning models with 72-81% accuracy for predicting the impact of smoking and drinking on body signals. My work also included visualizing data trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib, providing a clearer understanding of behavioral patterns related to smoking and drinking.

### Bob’s Burgers App Project  
*January 2023 – May 2023*  
I solo-developed an Android app named Bob's Burgers, demonstrating proficiency in key technologies such as RecyclerView, API integration, and MVVM architecture. My focus was on effective end-to-end app development, including robust error handling for invalid API requests, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, I designed a user-friendly interface with careful attention to color aesthetics and smooth animations, significantly enhancing user engagement and accessibility.
