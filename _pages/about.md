I am a fourth-year student at the university of rochester, majoring in computer science.

My interests are in machine learning and computer vision, and mutideciplingary areas.

I have a strong interest in machine learning and computer vision, and I am currently looking for a full-time position in MLE and preparing for the master's degree.

I have serveral good experience by doing xxxxp

# Engineering Experience

### Machine Learning Engineer Intern, Farsee2 Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China  
*July 2024 – September 2024*  
During my time at Farsee2 Technology, I designed an innovative method to reduce floating components in digital reconstruction models by 40%. This was achieved by utilizing ground truth depth to minimize loss, under the mentorship of Ph.D. Hailong Pan. I also developed a customized workflow for parallel computing across multiple machines, which significantly enhanced computational efficiency. Furthermore, I played a key role in contributing to the upgrade of the core algorithm for the company's digital reconstruction software, leading to more accurate and efficient model outputs.

### Researcher, Goergen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY  
*January 2024 – Present*  
As a researcher at the Goergen Institute for Data Science, I focused on the challenging issues of generative fairness and bias in large language models (LLMs), particularly within the context of political ideology. My work involved developing methods to calculate and evaluate political ideologies to conduct blind testing on LLMs. I automated the data collection process using Python and APIs, resulting in a 400% increase in efficiency. Additionally, I built and maintained a comprehensive database containing over 140,000 entries, facilitating extensive research into ideological biases.

### Research Assistant, Professor Chengliang Xu’s Lab, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY  
*May 2024 – Present*  
In this role, I developed a new computer vision model for TAL by implementing an end-to-end solution using Mamba. Under the mentorship of Researcher Pinxin Liu, I deployed, tested, and improved various machine learning tasks, ensuring successful execution of related paper codes on Linux servers. My work also involved modifying the ViT model to a Transformer++ structure and enhancing the previous model’s backbone, making it more suitable for testing and debugging by the research team.

### Technical Assistant, Wuhan Jingying Haitao Information Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China  
*June 2023 – October 2023*  
As a Technical Assistant, I created a biomedical patent database using MySQL to support the research of Dr. Conjing Ran and Ph.D. S Liu. My contributions led to a 20% improvement in data collection efficiency through the development of an automated web crawler script in Python. Additionally, I was responsible for collecting and labeling over 18,000 entries as sample data for language model training. I also utilized Lucidchart to design detailed Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) that optimized data visualization and management, encompassing over 100 keys and attributes.

### Research Assistant, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY  
*May 2022 – December 2022*  
In collaboration with Dr. Zhu, Dr. Jarvis, and other team members, I contributed to the digital reconstruction of the Jamestown Settlement and Elmina Castle using low-cost, image-based 3D Virtual Reality techniques. My responsibilities included disseminating high-resolution models into low-space-cost models for use in virtual reality environments. I utilized Agisoft Metashape and Unity to create detailed 3D models, conducting screening, cleaning, and restoration of raw image data for virtual reality applications. Additionally, I used Adobe Photoshop to repair overlapping virtual camera angles, manually cleaned interfering point clouds, and corrected shadows, lighting, and surface materials.

# Projects

### OpenJDK 17u-dev  
*July 2024 – August 2024*  
For the OpenJDK 17u-dev project, I authored a comprehensive step-by-step installation guide on GitHub for deploying JDK on Linux local testing environments. I also contributed to the testing and acceptance of pull request #2756(8313674) in Ubuntu 22, which helped in improving the stability and performance of the JDK.

### IMDB Database Project  
*August 2023 – December 2023*  
Leading a team of three, I ensured the database compliance and enhanced security of an IMDB Database project. My role involved focusing on testing, compatibility assessment, and debugging to prevent injection attacks. I also implemented a login system and customized functions for CRUD operations based on user type using JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML, Git, and CSS. Additionally, I redesigned the website's UI and incorporated advanced database security features.

### Body Signals Analysis Project  
*September 2023 – December 2023*  
In the Body Signals Analysis Project, I preprocessed over 900,000 records by selecting relevant attributes through feature engineering and reducing dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). I developed NLP machine learning models with 72-81% accuracy for predicting the impact of smoking and drinking on body signals. My work also included visualizing data trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib, providing a clearer understanding of behavioral patterns related to smoking and drinking.

### Bob’s Burgers App Project  
*January 2023 – May 2023*  
I solo-developed an Android app named Bob's Burgers, demonstrating proficiency in key technologies such as RecyclerView, API integration, and MVVM architecture. My focus was on effective end-to-end app development, including robust error handling for invalid API requests, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, I designed a user-friendly interface with careful attention to color aesthetics and smooth animations, significantly enhancing user engagement and accessibility.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
